# cov2clustering - Stable clustering of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from phylogenies

This repository contains scripts written in R (cov2clustering.R) for clustering and assigning cluster names of SARS-Cov-2 sequences. 

The input is an untimed phylogenetic tree and collection dates (either in a metadata.csv file or .json file from a timed phylogeny). A further variable can be added into the metadata file to restrict clustering to samples sharing this feature.
